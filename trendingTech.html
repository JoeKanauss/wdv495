<h1>Progressive Web Apps</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Website that acts and feels like a mobile app</li>
	<li>Better “feel” on mobile devices</li>
	<li>Takes advantage of website support (plugins, ease of deployment/maintenance) that apps lack</li>
	<li>More easily discoverable (search engines) than apps (app stores)</li>
	<li>Examples: Twitter, Washington Post</li>
	<li>Development of PWAs in 2005, but limitations made them less successful than native applications</li>
	<li>Mid-2010s, with enhancements with responsive web tools (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) became much more successful</li>
